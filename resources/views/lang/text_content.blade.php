$text_about_content="The beginning was fun, but also challenging. We started by sending emails manually
                            to email lists of about 5,000 contacts. Then, we spent nights in a graphics editor,
                            turning open and click rate metrics into informative reports. By morning, our first
                            clients received all the information on all the key metrics they wanted to see.
                            That’s why we like nobody understand the value of marketing automation

                        Since that time, we’ve been developing eSputnik to provide solutions to the real challenges our clients face every day, such as:
                        - to save time on creating and sending automated marketing messages without having to involve the IT team,
                        - to engage with customers through targeted multi-channel marketing,
                        - to inform marketing decisions with actionable automated dashboards";
