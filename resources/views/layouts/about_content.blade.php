                    <h4>About PURNELL</h4>
                    <h4>The best e-mail marketing</h4>
                    <p class="lead">The beginning was fun, but also challenging. We started by sending emails manually
                        to email lists of about 5,000 contacts. Then, we spent nights in a graphics editor,
                        turning open and click rate metrics into informative reports. By morning, our first
                        clients received all the information on all the key metrics they wanted to see.
                        That’s why we like nobody understand the value of marketing automation

                        Since that time, we’ve been developing PURNELL to provide solutions to the real challenges our clients face every day, such as:
                        - to save time on creating and sending automated marketing messages without having to involve the IT team,
                        - to engage with customers through targeted multi-channel marketing,
                        - to inform marketing decisions with actionable automated dashboards</p>
                    <p class="lead"> Inventing and implementing the best solutions for the tasks you come with. That’s how we keep improving PURNELL.

                  We envision an all-in-one system that would help its users focus on what really matters. That is, improving customer communications and maximizing the efficiency of marketing campaigns, instead of having to solve complex technical issues or code HTML emails.

                    We’re constantly working to develop PURNELL, applying the best practices and inventing new marketing solutions ourselves. Every day we’re implementing new features, and every week we let our clients experience them firsthand.</p>
